\title{Get a list of tiles that a country polygon intersects with}
\usage{
getTilesCtryIntersect(ctryCode)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctryCode}{The country's ISO3 code}
}
\value{
None
}
\description{
Create a dataframe mapping each country in the rworldmap to the VIIRS tiles which they intersect with
    and thus need to be retrieved to process their nightlight imagery. Since some functions use this
    dataframe for long-term processing, omitCountries can eliminate countries that should be excluded
    from the list hence from processing. Countries can be added in the omitCountries function.
    Default is "none".
}
\examples{
mapCtryPolyToTiles() map all countries

mapCtryPolyToTiles(ctryCodes="all", omitCountries="none") map all countries, no countries omitted

mapCtryPolyToTiles(omitCountries=c("error", "missing")) will not omit countries that do not have polygons
on GADM
