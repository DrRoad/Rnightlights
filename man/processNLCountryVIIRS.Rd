\usage{
processNLCountryVIIRS(ctryCode, nlYearMonth, cropMaskMethod = "rast",
  extractMethod = "rast", fnStats = stats)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctryCode}{}

\item{nlYearMonth}{}

\item{cropMaskMethod}{("rast" or "gdal") Whether to use rasterize or gdal-based functions to 
crop and mask the country rasters}

\item{extractMethod}{("rast" or "gdal") Whether to use rasterize or gdal-based functions 
to crop and mask the country rasters}

\item{stats}{the statistics to calculate. If not provided will calculate the stats specified 
in \code{pkg_options("stats")}}
}
\value{
None
}
\description{
Given a \code{countryCode}, \code{yearMonth} and preferred processing methods 
    \code{cropMaskMethod} and \code{extractMethod}, this function will first check if the 
    data already exists in the cache. First it will check if the data file exists and if it 
    does not it will create a dataframe of the country data containing only the administrative
    properties and move to processing. If the data file exists it will check to see if the 
    particular year month already exists. If it exists, it will exit with a message. If it does
    not exist, it will load the country data file and move on to processing.
}
\details{
Processing consists of:
    \enumerate{ 
       \item Reading in the country polygon in ESRI Shapefile format
       \item Reading in the tiles that the particular country intersects with and then clipping 
       the tile(s) to the country boundary
       \item Extract the data from the clipped raster and compute various statistics at the lowest admin level in the country.
       \item Finally, these stats are appended to the data frame and written to the data file.
    }

NOTE: \code{processNLCountryVIIRS()} assumes that all inputs are available and will not 
    attempt to download them. It should ideally be called from the function \code{processNtLts()}
    which does all the preparation for processing. \code{processNtLts()} which can process 
    multiple countries and time periods will download all the required tiles and polygons prior to
    calling \code{processNLCountryVIIRS()}. \code{getCtryNlData} can also be used with the option
    \code{ignoreMissing=FALSE} which will call \code{processNtLts} in the background.
