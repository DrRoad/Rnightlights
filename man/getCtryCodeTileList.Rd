\name{getCtryCodeTileList}
\alias{getCtryCodeTileList}
\title{Returns a list of VIIRS nightlight tiles that a country or countries intersects with}
\usage{
getCtryCodeTileList(ctryCodes, omitCountries = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{ctryCodes}{character vector of country codes to process}

\item{omitCountries}{countries to exclude from processing. This is helpful when the 
number of countries to exclude is smaller than the number to process e.g. when 
one wants to process all countries and exclude countries that take long to process i.e. 
omitCountries = "long"}
}
\value{
TRUE/FALSE
}
\description{
Given a list of countries, this function will provide alist of VIIRS nightlight tiles 
    that intersect with them. This helps in processing multiple countries by determining
    which nightlight tiles are required for processing by allowing the download of all 
    required tiles before processing.
